## 🚨 **Summary**

**Out of 13 modules:**
- 0 are fully working (100%)
- 9 are partially working (50-70%)
- 2 are barely working (30%)
- 2 are not working (0%)

**Major Issues:**
1. No edit functionality anywhere
2. Many buttons are dummy/alert only
3. Several modules have no API integration
4. Bulk upload doesn't actually work
